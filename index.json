creating a second directed graph structure by performing on a second LM the same processing as that performed on the first LM; comparing nodes in the first directed graph structure with nodes in the second directed graph structure to detect nodes other than nodes including a corresponding character string; adding to the first directed graph structure the node detected in the second directed graph structure among the detected nodes as a first branch node; and estimating the format, based on the first directed graph structure including the first branch node added thereto.","tags":[],"title":"Method for estimating format of log message and computer and computer program therefor","type":"publication"},{"authors":["IBM Tokyo SOC"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1490154094,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1490154094,"objectID":"b9a0f04e4d98e7d80e9563bba12fc604","permalink":"https://m-mizutani.github.io//publication/socreport2016_2h/","publishdate":"2017-03-22T12:41:34+09:00","relpermalink":"/publication/socreport2016_2h/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"IBM Tokyo SOC 情報分析レポート 2016年下半期","type":"publication"},{"authors":["IBM Tokyo SOC"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1471837294,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1471837294,"objectID":"377e7b675edb894519693e02e5547e02","permalink":"https://m-mizutani.github.io//publication/socreport2016_1h/","publishdate":"2016-08-22T12:41:34+09:00","relpermalink":"/publication/socreport2016_1h/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"IBM Tokyo SOC 情報分析レポート 2016年上半期","type":"publication"},{"authors":["IBM Tokyo SOC"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1457149294,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1457149294,"objectID":"4b690492d879a40f9d0a5e59d531d63b","permalink":"https://m-mizutani.github.io//publication/socreport2015_2h/","publishdate":"2016-03-05T12:41:34+09:00","relpermalink":"/publication/socreport2015_2h/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"IBM Tokyo SOC 情報分析レポート 2015年下半期","type":"publication"},{"authors":["IBM Tokyo SOC"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1440214894,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1440214894,"objectID":"2a56aa3b8f836b9396c4e082b82b82d2","permalink":"https://m-mizutani.github.io//publication/socreport2015_1h/","publishdate":"2015-08-22T12:41:34+09:00","relpermalink":"/publication/socreport2015_1h/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"IBM Tokyo SOC 情報分析レポート 2015年上半期","type":"publication"},{"authors":["IBM Tokyo SOC"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1426995694,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1426995694,"objectID":"7623086b5e55a866a09a23062b452cc4","permalink":"https://m-mizutani.github.io//publication/socreport2014_2h/","publishdate":"2015-03-22T12:41:34+09:00","relpermalink":"/publication/socreport2014_2h/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"IBM Tokyo SOC 情報分析レポート 2014年下半期","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Masayoshi Mizutani"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1377138334,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1377138334,"objectID":"7d3bafdb0c66e4163e61d71d9d84c28a","permalink":"https://m-mizutani.github.io//publication/ccs2013/","publishdate":"2013-08-22T11:25:34+09:00","relpermalink":"/publication/ccs2013/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Incremental Mining of System Log Format","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Masayoshi Mizutani","Keiji Takeda","Jun Murai"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1256178703,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1256178703,"objectID":"d7eacd32672e450ce4115e586de7a621","permalink":"https://m-mizutani.github.io//publication/ipsj201910/","publishdate":"2009-10-22T11:31:43+09:00","relpermalink":"/publication/ipsj201910/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"An Analysis of Web Distributed Malwares and A Proposal of Their Detection Method","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Masayoshi Mizutani","Akira Kanai","Keiji Takeda","Jun Murai"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1253586697,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1253586697,"objectID":"3e4ccf17ed5bba3ae82ecb74e49dbd7e","permalink":"https://m-mizutani.github.io//publication/ipsj201909/","publishdate":"2009-09-22T11:31:37+09:00","relpermalink":"/publication/ipsj201909/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"A Malware Detection Method based on Communication Commonality – Implementation and Evaluation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Masayoshi Mizutani","Shin Shirahata","Masaki Minami","Jun Murai"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1132626537,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1132626537,"objectID":"ae353d9dbd5ad0568bd5df9b59bdf13a","permalink":"https://m-mizutani.github.io//publication/ieice2005/","publishdate":"2005-11-22T11:28:57+09:00","relpermalink":"/publication/ieice2005/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"The Design and Implementation of Session Based IDS","type":"publication"}]
